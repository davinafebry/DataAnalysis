# Comparison of DBSCAN and K-means Algorithms Prediction Model for Heart Failure Dataset
One of the roles managed by the heart is human survival, which necessitates the heart's protection and awareness of its harm. The last stage of any coronary ailment is cardiovascular failure. The problem of heart failure-related fatalities necessitates the development of a survival prediction tool. The patient electronic clinical record apparatus may be used to assess symptoms, body features, and clinical research center test esteems that can be used to do biostatistical dissects aimed at highlighting instances and connections not recognized by clinical experts. AI is a solution for predicting tolerant endurance from the information generated and for recognizing the most important components among those recalled for their clinical records. There are several shortcomings of the currently available risk prediction models for Heart Failur. Most previous models are developed using traditional statistical approaches, one of them is regression modeling.

In this study, the dataset used in this research is Heart Failure Clinical Records data taken from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data). The dataset was published in 2020 with 13 features, namely: age, anemia, creatinine, diabetes, ejection_fraction, high_blood_pressure, platelets, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, sex, smoking, time.
